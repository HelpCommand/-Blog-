# In-person con experiences of a noob. #

## Quick background ##

A short description of my background and what has me interested in the infosec field. Pre-covid I was only looking at what skills I could learn to make me a more valued asset to my employer in my current Desktop support role. I looked at our strategic technology plan and saw that internal and external pentests were something that we needed done. At the same time my state was offering a program that allowed people that have never finished a college degree to get an associate or technical certificate in high demand fields. I enrolled in the Digital Forensics path which allowed you to study and take the Comptia A+ and Sec+, and since the program was free I couldn't pass that up. Flash forward to the spring of 2020 I had pass both cert exams on my first try, and completed my course work. I was hooked on forensics and incident response, and started to look for every training I could afford at the time which wasn't much. I found [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) and then set a goal of finishing all 6 learning paths in 90 days, which I completed in under 90. I've now moved to the [Blue Teams Labs Online](https://blueteamlabs.online/) site working through all of their labs and challenges. I have also finished their junior analyst training and look to start their Level 1 training soon. This drive to learn as much about DFIR also had me listening to all of the podcasts I could find. I found one that I really liked called "Detections" but then found out they started a different one called [Positively Blue Team](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn3ubU-KnCznjNHcNPmWlUg). During one of their episodes they mentioned a discord group called [Dead Pixel Sec](https://deadpixelsec.com/) and how they were a group of truely awesome people. My next step was to search out this group, I needed a more active discord to join and this was promising. Flash forward a few months of forcing myself to be more outgoing and actively interacting with [Dead Pixel Sec](https://deadpixelsec.com/) which has been such a blessing. Words can't describe how open and accepting this group is and it's allowed me to meet some great people. After solving a member created a crypto challenge I won tickets to [Blue Team Con](https://blueteamcon.com/) in Chicago.

## [Blue Team Con](https://blueteamcon.com/)

So now we have my background out of the way let's get into my first in-person infosec con experience. The day of the con I got dropped off for the train like a middle aged student going to school for the first time. Sporting my favorite [Innocent Lives Foundation](https://www.innocentlivesfoundation.org/) shirt and Microsoft insider backpack I walked up to someone and asked "Is this the bus for the train to Chicago?" They looked at my shirt and asked if I was going to Blue Team Con and I said yes. What followed was a 2 hour bus/train ride getting to know someone from my area involved in a group of infosec professionals I didn't know existed. We walked from the station to the hotel, registered and entered the con and they told me the basics of what to do at a con. We went to the [Mental Health Hackers](https://www.mentalhealthhackers.org/) room and they introduced me to people there. I picked up stickers for my wife and kids. Then we walked to the different booths, talking to the vendors and getting more swag and stickers. At this time they went back to the [Mental Health Hackers](https://www.mentalhealthhackers.org/) to hangout and I went to the first of the talks I wanted to hear that day. When ever I would work up the courage to talk to people I used the suggested question of "What do you do?" or "What do you think of the con so far?" Although these seem standard, the action of talking to new people is so far out of my comfort zone. But by doing things that scare me allowed me to meet and talk to someone that was also in [Dead Pixel Sec](https://deadpixelsec.com/) and is the organizer of a BSIDES on the EastCoast. As well as meeting someone that is a lead SOC analyst. I also was able to get a resume review and have someone outside of my family tell me that I was on the right path and my skills look really good and promising. I know that [Blue Team Con](https://blueteamcon.com/)n will definitely be on my schedule to attend next year if I can make it. There were a few things that everyone I talked to said, first was to keep my head up and applying and second go to [GrrCON](https://grrcon.com/). 

## [GrrCON](https://grrcon.com/)

I'll have to admit that I didn't know anything about a lot of things when I started my journey, but I quickly learned that when [The Blind Hacker](https://twitter.com/TheBlindHacker) posts in [Dead Pixel Sec](https://deadpixelsec.com/) about supporting or checking something out then you check the thing out. When an announcement was posted about letting people know about [ILFest](https://www.innocentlivesfoundation.org/ilfest-2021/) I clicked on it not knowing what I would be seeing or getting into. Man if there is a group of people that rival [Dead Pixel Sec](https://deadpixelsec.com/) for awesomeness it is the [Innocent Lives Foundation](https://www.innocentlivesfoundation.org/) and their supporters. To be fair there is a decent amount of crossover between the two. I watched all of the videos and podcasts I could find about [Innocent Lives Foundation](https://www.innocentlivesfoundation.org/) and their members. When ILFest happened I made sure to watch the whole day and quickly became a support/cheerleader and slight groupie/fanboy. I promise this will be relevant in a second. After hanging out in their [twitch fireside/game nights](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1149561066) and following them on [twitter](https://twitter.com/InnocentOrg) I saw that they were going to be going to [GrrCON](https://grrcon.com/) and having a charity auction. I wasn't planning on going to the con until someone giving away a free ticket showed up on my Twitter feed. My fomo on the chance to meet [Innocent Lives Foundation](https://www.innocentlivesfoundation.org/) people in person won out. I took a personal day and drove up to GrrCON with the help of a stranger on twitter to meet more strangers from the internet. 
Again dressed basically in the same gear ( note I have bought other [Innocent Lives Foundation](https://www.innocentlivesfoundation.org/) shirts since then), I walked into the con and heard someone say "Look ILF". So no less than a minute of being in the convention center the fine people from ILF found me. I introduced myself, thanked them for what they did and made my way into the con. I'm not going to lie, wearing an [Innocent Lives Foundation](https://www.innocentlivesfoundation.org/) shirt is a great ice breaker, most of the booths I went to asked if I worked with them. I told them no, I'm just a cheerleader till I can improve my osint skills to better match what they require. I made sure to talk to as many people as I could push myself to this time. Talking to booth staff about open positions and products they offer. At lunch I answered yes when two people asked if they could share my table since I was wearing my badge. That simple yes, though a huge step out of my comfort zone, allowed me the chance to listen to a passionate description of the steps this person took to solve the [black badge crypto challenge](https://grrcon.com/crypto/). I forgot to mention but at no time at either con did anyone ever treat me differently when they found out that I worked desktop support.  After lunch I made it to the auction to support and buy art and memorabilia. While the auction was going on, the person I met from the train on my way to Chicago sat down and said they were glad I could make it. They introduced me to more members of the group from my area and we were able to talk for a few minutes. I was then able to talk to more of the [Innocent Lives Foundation](https://www.innocentlivesfoundation.org/) members and was able to talk to their COO and ask what steps I could do to improve my skills to better match their need for the preditor identification team. They took the time to talk with me and listen to my experiences with csam and investigations at work. I was able to walk around to a few more booths, listen to a few more talks and then I started my drive home. 

Take Away

What I have experienced by going to two in-person cons is nothing short of inspirational and to sound sappy life changing. I make sure to push my comfort zone as much as I can and look for different ways to engage with people. This year I have taken part in the Defcon OpenSOC, and volunteered for [The Diana Initiative](https://www.dianainitiative.org/) though online still provided a glimpse into what conferences can be like. Now that I have been to two in-person cons I will definitely plan on making it to as many local conventions in the midwest as I can possibly with [Thotcon](https://www.thotcon.org/) being my next one. If you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read this and I hope it offers some insight of what a noob con goer can experience.
